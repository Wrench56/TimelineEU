My main goal was to provide enough visual material to showcase the innovations & events of the EU without much explanation. For this, I used various graphs and charts along with some minor explanatory sketch. Feel free to raise an issue at my <a href=\"https://github.com/Wrench56/TimelineEU\">GitHub</a> page if you find any inaccuracy.",
